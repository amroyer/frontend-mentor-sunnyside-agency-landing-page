### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

In its current form, the site looks a little strange on tablets, something I should take the time to fix. In addition, it doesn't play well with dark mode at the moment, and at the very least I should take the time to make it look consistent.
